# Loong Arch Linux

Loong Arch Linux, an Arch Linux distribution ported for the LoongArch architecture, strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling release model. It can run on machines with Loongson 3A5000, 3C5000(L), 3A6000, 3C6000 etc. processors with LSX support. This project is inherited and maintained by [Linux Club of Peking University](https://github.com/lcpu-club/) at [lcpu-club/loongarch-packages](https://github.com/lcpu-club/loongarch-packages), [lcpu-club/loongshot](https://github.com/lcpu-club/loongshot) and [lcpu-club/devtools-loong64](https://github.com/lcpu-club/devtools-loong64), and this is currently only a historical archive here.
